# projectbreakout
This games objective is to break all the blocks at the top of the screen and indoing so collecting a high score.

Just like in Pong there is a paddle that theplayer controls to bounce the ball and the trajectory of the ball is determinedby which angle the ball hits the paddle.  The player have a set number of livesthat are lost if the ball leaves the playing field.

The following are requirements that are crucial to the success of the project:


•Pixel graphics that updates smoothly.

•How the ball interacts (physics) with the environment.

•High score implementation.

•Multiple difficulties.

•Both one and two player modes.

Some optional features that we may include if we have enough time are as follows:
•Power ups in the form of different abilities that can be used.

•Blocks have different health gauges and in so takes multiple hits to destroy.

•Health points can be displayed using the I/O shield LEDS
